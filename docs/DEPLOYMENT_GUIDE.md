## Prerequisites
To begin, you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- An Azure subscription

Follow these steps to deploy the Microsoft Learn LTI tool:

# Clone the repo
1. Open Git
2. Enter in the command in the Git console
   * `git clone -b edx.1 https://github.com/microsoft/Learn-LTI.git`

You have now cloned the repo.

## After Cloning
* In the cloned repo, inside the deployment directory, execute the file **run.bat**.
* run.bat bypasses signing requirements and runs Deploy.ps1 automatically.
* You should now see the Microsoft Learn LTI Tool script popup.
